    <p>
        If you enable "Send deployments automatically", the Atlassian Cloud plugin will automatically send a deployment
        event to all configured
        Jira sites when a build step matching the regular expression has finished.
    </p>
    <p>
        The plugin expects the build step name to contain the environment name (like "deploy to prod").
        Please make sure that the regular expression contains "(?&lt;envName&gt;.*)" so that the plugin can extract
        the environment name from the step name.
